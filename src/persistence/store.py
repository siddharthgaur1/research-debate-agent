"""SQLite run history.

Two tables: `runs` holds the latest snapshot for cheap status reads, and
`transitions` is the append-only audit log — one row per node that touched the
state. Replaying a run means folding the transitions in `seq` order, which is
what makes a finished debate auditable rather than just archived.

stdlib sqlite3 rather than an ORM: the schema is two tables and never joins.
